## 📝 Description / Overview
<p align="justify">
The <strong>Badminton Tournament System</strong> is a <strong>Java console-based</strong> application designed to efficiently organize and manage badminton competitions. Users can choose the tournament type between <strong>Single Elimination or Double Elimination</strong> and navigate a clear, interactive menu that offers options to <strong>Register players, View players and brackets, Start the tournament, Update player or bracket information, and Delete players.</strong> The system demonstrates the four key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism, through its well-structured class design and method implementation. By integrating exception handling, arrays, and user-driven console interactions, the project provides a practical and engaging simulation of real-world tournament management, highlighting both functionality and good programming practice.
