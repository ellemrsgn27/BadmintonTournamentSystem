## 📝 Description / Overview
The Badminton Tournament System is a Java console-based application designed to efficiently organize and manage badminton competitions. Users can choose the tournament type between Single Elimination or Double Elimination and navigate a clear, interactive menu that offers options to Register players, View players and brackets, Start the tournament, Update player or bracket information, and Delete players. The system demonstrates the four key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism, through its well-structured class design and method implementation. By integrating exception handling, arrays, and user-driven console interactions, the project provides a practical and engaging simulation of real-world tournament management, highlighting both functionality and good programming practice.
