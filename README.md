## 📝 Description / Overview
<p align="justify">
The <strong>Badminton Tournament System</strong> is a <strong>Java console-based</strong> application designed to efficiently organize and manage badminton competitions. Users can choose the tournament type between <strong>Single Elimination or Double Elimination</strong> and navigate a clear, interactive menu that offers options to <strong>Register players, View players and brackets, Start the tournament, Update player or bracket information, and Delete players.</strong> The system demonstrates the four key <strong>bject-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism</strong>, through its well-structured class design and method implementation. By integrating exception handling, arrays, and user-driven console interactions, the project provides a practical and engaging simulation of real-world tournament management, highlighting both functionality and good programming practice. 

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Applied
## 🔒 Encapsulation
Class fields such as `name` in Player, `teamName/player1/player2` in Team, and `participants` in Tournament are private. Access is controlled through getters and setters, ensuring data safety and validity.
## 🎭 Abstraction
Abstract classes like Participant and Tournament hide complex logic.
Only essential methods are exposed, such as:
- `getDisplayName()` in Participant
- `createParticipantFromInput()` in Tournament
The system can work with different types of participants without needing to know their internal details.
